Your roof protects one of your biggest investments—your home. Over time, it can develop unsightly and damaging moss, algae, and black streaks. Watch for these warning signs:

1. **Visible Green or Black Streaks:** Indicate algae and moss growth.
2. **Shingle Granule Loss:** Granules in gutters signal roof wear.
3. **Water Staining:** Dark streaks under eaves can mean trapped moisture.
4. **Moss or Lichen Patches:** Can lift shingles and lead to leaks.
5. **Excessive Debris:** Leaves and twigs trap moisture and accelerate decay.

Keeping your roof clean helps prevent costly repairs and maintains your home’s curb appeal.
