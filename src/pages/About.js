      <section className="about-warning">
        <p>
          <strong>Beware</strong> of new companies or those from different industries that
          claim to provide high-quality work but employ inferior equipment and cleaning methods.
          Many of these businesses overcharge, underdeliver, and lack proper licensing and
          insurance, resulting in unfortunate incidents like ruined siding and inadequate cleaning.
          Opt for a local, reputable company with a proven track record of excellence.
